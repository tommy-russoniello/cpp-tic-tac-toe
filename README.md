# cpp-tic-tac-toe
This is a simple, purely command-line based tic-tac-toe game originally written when
I first learned C++. It was the first game I ever wrote in any language as well as
the first moderately sized project I ever completed on, and for, my own.

Later, I decided to add some revisions to it, while still keeping its original feel.

The game is designed to be played by entering numbers on the numpad to mark the
 corresponding spaces on the board. It works on both Windows and UNIX operating
 systems.
 
Includes both a 2-player mode and a 1-player mode against a bot opponent that is able to play as either Xs or Os.

For Mac OSX, compile with `-lncurses` for proper
screen clearing.
